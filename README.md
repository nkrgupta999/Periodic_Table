# Periodic_Table
Creating a periodic table using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves designing a table structure using HTML tags, styling it with CSS, and adding interactive functionality with JavaScript.
To create the basic structure of the periodic table, HTML tags such as table, tr, td, and th can be used to represent the rows and columns. Each element can be represented by a td element with its respective atomic number, symbol, and name.
